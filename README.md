# USPS-Data-Analysis
Performed data analysis on two sets of experimental data used for tracking USPS shipments in order to find the data structure that yields the most ideal balance in run-time performance.

## Analysis
When generating the data needed to plot a graph showing average search and insert times, 
we designed functions within the classes that performed the increments of adding 100 new pieces of data from the dataset and searching 100 times for values within the expected range of random number values that can be searched. 
This greatly helped keep the actual experiment concise and easy to debug. 
Overall the results of our project reveal a lot about the real world time to complete that occur with different types of data structures:
